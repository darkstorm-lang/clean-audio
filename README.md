# Script to clean audio files for intended for use in anki
## https://github.com/tycho-lang/clean-audio
Recording audio in anki (on mac at least) has a habit of putting bursts of static noise at the beginning and end of the recorded audio that are very distracting. It also has variable loudness depending on mic and vocal arrangement.  This will remove leading and trailing silence and noise bursts then normalize the remaining audio.
